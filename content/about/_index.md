Hi, my name is Flossie but everyone calls me Sassie.

I like to organize, tidy, keep things simple and clear. But I also like glitter and colors. This job allows me to combine the two!
So I can make people happier without ever feeling like I'm working for a living.
I love to learn and discover continuously, it's important to stay amazed like children!

My key words are: creation, sharing and careful.

Let's catch up together and make this world a better place ! ðŸŒ·
