#### Project Details

Tarmakk is my first real big project I had to realize. This one is exclusive to Payfit company.

The starter template I had to work on was originally build with material design. However, feedbacks from the users showed some flaws in the daily usage, from different application's components and elements.

My biggest challenge was to simplify a full application that needs to be used by so many different user profiles such as : IT, HR, HRBP, Finance and Datas.

I loved working on this project with the wonderful Kader Ovski and meeting the friendly Payfit's team !
