#### Project Details

Working on Goldorak was really fun! It took me back to childhood, I wanted this feeling on this project through my design product. Users are IT collaborators so they enjoyed this artistic decision ! Creating the planets was my favourite part. 

My challenge was to create an app that handles a whole complex IT system I wasn't familiar with.

Thank you again to trust me !
